# mp4 → WebGL: iterative shaders

A frontend + iteration loop where you upload an `.mp4`, and Claude writes a
generative WebGL2 fragment shader from scratch that captures the *feel* of the
video — looping, deterministic, time-synced.

The shader synthesises every pixel from `u_time` / `u_resolution` /
`u_loop_phase`. The source video is never sampled at runtime; it is the target
the loop is trying to match.

See `specs.md` for the full design contract.

## Setup

```bash
npm install
npx playwright install chromium
cp .env.example .env.local   # then add your ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
npm run seed                 # import the bundled sample mp4s
npm run dev
```

Open <http://localhost:3000>, pick a sample (or upload your own), click
`New iteration`.

## Environment

- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` — required when the SDK backend is active (which it is
  by default whenever this var is set). The local Claude Code CLI is used as
  a fallback when the key is missing, or when `CLAUDE_BACKEND=cli` is set
  (handy in local dev so iterations bill against your Claude Code
  subscription instead of per-token).
- `CLAUDE_GENERATION_MODEL`, `CLAUDE_ANALYSIS_MODEL`, `CLAUDE_DIAGNOSIS_MODEL` —
  optional model overrides. Defaults: Opus 4.7 for analysis/generation, Sonnet
  4.6 for diagnosis (cheap diagnosis is fine).
- `APP_PASSWORD` (+ optional `APP_USERNAME`, default `demo`) — when set, the
  whole app sits behind HTTP basic auth. Used for shared-link demos. Playwright
  inside the container is given the same creds automatically.

## Deploy (Fly.io)

```bash
fly launch --no-deploy            # accept defaults; uses the bundled fly.toml
fly secrets set \
  ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-... \
  APP_PASSWORD=your-shared-password
fly deploy
```

Caveats:
- Backend calls run through the Anthropic SDK in the container — visitors burn
  per-token credit on every iteration. The bundled `fly.toml` defaults to
  Sonnet 4.6 / Haiku 4.5 to cap cost; override with `fly secrets set
  CLAUDE_GENERATION_MODEL=claude-opus-4-7` if you want Opus.
- No persistent volume by default — restarts wipe uploads and re-seed the
  bundled samples. Add `[[mounts] source = "videos" destination = "/app/videos"`
  to `fly.toml` and `fly volumes create videos --size 1` if you need persistence.
- The VM is sized `performance-2x` / 4GB because Chromium + ffmpeg run inside
  the request path; smaller machines OOM during capture.

## Architecture

- `app/` — Next.js app router. `app/page.tsx` is the homepage gallery,
  `app/video/[videoId]/page.tsx` is the overlay viewer,
  `app/render/[videoId]/[iterationId]/page.tsx` is the deterministic capture
  page used by Playwright.
- `lib/shader/` — GLSL scaffold + uniform contract + runtime that mounts the
  generated body inside a fullscreen quad and animates it.
- `lib/pipeline/` — analyze (ffmpeg + Claude vision), generate (Claude code),
  compile (headless Chromium with WebGL2), capture (Playwright screenshots),
  score (rgb-L2 + ssim-like + flow-magnitude correlation + loop-continuity),
  diagnose (Claude vision over matched frame pairs).
- `lib/persist.ts` — atomic JSON state writes at `videos/{id}/state.json`.
- `lib/events.ts` + `app/api/videos/[videoId]/stream/route.ts` — SSE bus that
  pushes iteration lifecycle updates to the overlay UI.

## Notes / deviations from `specs.md`

- LPIPS and optical-flow correlation are computed in pure JS as a perceptual
  proxy (RGB-L2 + structural-similarity-like + luma frame-difference
  correlation). The orchestrator stores a `notes` field marking these as
  proxies. Wiring real LPIPS via Python is straightforward; see
  `lib/pipeline/score.ts`.
- The frontend live channel is SSE rather than WebSocket — same role, simpler
  to ship in Next.js app router.
